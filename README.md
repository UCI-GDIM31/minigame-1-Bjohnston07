## Devlog
Write your Devlog here.

Imagine a workplace. Within the workplace are cubicles. However, the cubicles need someone to man it in order for it to function. In this metaphor,
the scene is the workplace, the cubicle is the game object, and the employee is the component. Without a workplace, there is no place to work at all as without a scene
there is no area to place objects. Without cubicles, there is no connection between the employee and their workplace in order for it to work as without game objects
there is nothing to see or interact with. Without the employee, the cubicle is all for nothing since nothing is making it work as without components, there is no added
function to the components.
